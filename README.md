## How to Hack Hacker News-Codecademy Project

### General information

Hacker News is a popular website run by Y Combinator. Itâ€™s widely known by people in the tech industry as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.

In this project, I worked with a table named hacker_news that contains stories from Hacker News since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:

+ ```title```: the title of the story
+ ```user```: the user who submitted the story
+ ```score```: the score of the story
+ ```timestamp```: the time of the story
+ ```url```: the link of the story

The data was made publicly available under the MIT license.

#### [Hacker News Top Five Stories](#hacker-news-top-five-stories):

 ``SELECT title, score``
 
 ``FROM hacker_news``
 
 ``ORDER BY score DESC``
 
 ``LIMIT 5;``
